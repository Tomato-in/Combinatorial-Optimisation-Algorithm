# Combinatorial-Optimisation-Algorithm

## Here are some combinatorial optimization algorithms for the field of transportation.

This is my first project, I am happy to share my codes with you.

Those days, I am learning transportation network equilibrium theory. And I am going to use python to implement some of these algorithms. Welcome to exchange corrections and make progress together.

### 1. Dijkstra
This algorithm is designed to find the shortest path between the start point and the end point in the graphy.

### 2. Floyd-Warshall
This algorithm is designed to find shortest paths between any two points in the graphy.

### 3. Yen
This algorithm is designed to find k shortest paths between the start point and the end point in the graphy.

<strong><em>In the first three algorithms, when we talk about the shortest way, we assume that they are paths without repeating points.</em></strong>

### 4. To be continued...
